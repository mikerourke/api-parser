batch

GET /1/batch

The batch endpoint allows you to make multiple GET requests to the Trello API in a single request. By batching GET requests together, you can reduce the volume of calls you are making to the API and more easily stay within your API rate limit. The batch endpoint can not be called recursively; requests containing the batch url will be ignored.

Arguments
urls (required)
Valid Values: list of API v1 GET routes. Maximum of 10 routes allowed. The routes should begin with a forward slash and should not include the API version number - e.g. "urls=/members/trello,/cards/[cardId]"
